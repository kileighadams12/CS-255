DriverPass business requirements and system design documents

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was about designing a web-based system for a client that helps students prepare for their driving tests. The client wanted a platform where students could sign up, book driving lessons, take practice tests, and see their progress. They also needed staff and instructors to have tools to manage lessons, track student activity, and handle system updates, all in one place.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job translating the client's goals into clear requirements and a system design that matched what they needed. I was able to break down the different user roles and features and organize them so they made sense for how the system would actually be used.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could go back, I would spend more time refining my UML diagrams to make sure the connections between classes, like how lessons relate to students and instructors, were easier to follow. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused on how the system would feel for someone actually using it, like making sure students could easily schedule a lesson or see test results without confusion. Including these details in the design helped ensure the system would be useful and straightforward for the end user. Considering user needs is important because if the system doesn’t match what people need or is too complicated, it won’t actually solve the problems it was built for.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When I design software, I start by breaking down what the system needs to do and who will use it, then map out the workflows and components in diagrams to see how everything connects. In future projects, I would like to get feedback earlier in the design process and consider creating small prototypes to test ideas before finalizing the design, which would help catch issues early and improve the user experience.
